# mines
Game created using C with no gui and is equivalent to Microsoft Minesweeper.
Rules:
  use NUM pad '8' '6' '2' '4' for up right down left movements respectively
  5 for flagging/unflaging the bomb
  your current position will be show by an number 
  if your current position is flagged it would be shown by 'f'
Consider that you are a real minesweeper and you a mine detector in your hand. Now you can scan the mines in the surrounding and you are supposed to flag it. If your current position has a bomb you will be exploded once if you moved from your current block. So make sure to flag your current position if your instinct says that there is a bomb.
You have got only 10 bombs and 10 flags make sure to place it wisely.
Your current position would be denoted by a number and that number indicates the number of bombs nearer to that position.
